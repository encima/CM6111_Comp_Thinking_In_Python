# Long Division

Division: First digit of the divident divided by the divisor, thie gives us the quotient
Multiplication: Multiply quotient by divisor to gives us the product
Subtraction: Subtract product from `working dividend`
Next digit: Bring down the next digit and combine with the remainder, this is our `working dividend`

```

1. Is 21 greater than 1? Yes. So we cannot divide and move on.
2. Multiply quotient (21) by the divisor. 21 x 0 = 0. 0 is our product
3. Now we perform subtraction. 1 - 0 = 1, so 1 is our remainder.
4. Bring down the next digit to form the working dividend

1. Is 21 greater than 16? Yes. So we put a 0 on the result and move on.
2. 21 x result = 0
3. 16 - 0 = 16
4. Bring down the next number to form a new working dividend

1. Is 21 greater than 160? Nope. It fits in around 7 times so 7 is our new result
2. 21 x 7 = 147
3. 160 -147 = 13, this is our remainder
4. Bring down the next number!

1. Is 21 greater than 136. Nope. It is about 6 times.
2. 21 x 6 = 126
3. 136 - 126 = 10
4. Bring down the next!

1. Is 21 greater than 105. Nope. It goes in 5 times.
2. 21 x 5 = 105
3. 105 - 105 = 0
4. We are at 0, so we are done!

If we had a remainder, but no digits, we keep bringing down imginary zeros until we get 0. Otherwise, that is a recurring value.
